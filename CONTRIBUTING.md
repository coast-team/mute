## What should I know before I get started?

### Mute objectives and dependencies.

Mute is an open-source project led by the [Coast Team](https://team.inria.fr/coast/) in Loria/Inria Grand Est. It's a P2P collaborative text-editor
that implements conflict-free merge algorithm for synchronous/asynchronous collaborations:

[André et al., 2013]<a id="ref-1"> Luc André, Stéphane Martin, Gérald Oster et Claudia-Lavinia Ignat. **Supporting Adaptable Granularity of Changes for Massive-scale Collaborative Editing**. In *Proceedings of the international conference on collaborative computing: networking, applications and worksharing - CollaborateCom 2013*. IEEE Computer Society, Austin, Texas, USA, october 2013, pages 50–59. doi: [10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2013.254123](https://dx.doi.org/10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2013.254123). url: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00903813/.


Mute is based on several dependencies which implements a part of the algorithm and which can be reused for other project.

Here's a list of the big ones:

* [Mute](https://github.com/coast-team/mute) - Mute client part. It's the main component of Mute which consist of Angular Web App.
* [Mute-Core](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-core) - Mute Service part: provide construction of Mute data structures and communication between
Mute client and Netflux.
* [Netflux](https://github.com/coast-team/netflux) - P2P network algorithm which is in charge of communication. It implements several network topology and is built over WebSocket.
* [Mute-structs](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-structs) - Defines Mute Data structures for messages and communication protocol.

There are many more (like bot-storage or identification package), but this list should be a good starting point.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Mute. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#mute-objectives-and-dependencies)**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Acoast-team)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#mute-objectives-and-dependencies) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. **Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse or a keyboard shortcut.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
* **Inclued log from your collaborative session**, use the button in bottom-right of Mute to download your log file.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem in latest version or in production version?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after cache wipe) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Mute?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of Mute are you using?**
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
* **What's the name and version of the browser you're using**?

git commit messages.

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Typescript Styleguide

Styleguide for Typescript are defined in each repository within .tslint file.
The global styleguide is the one from [Angular Styleguide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide).

### Specs Styleguide

Some project use [Ava]() for spec and some other use [Jasmine](). You could use the one already present in the repository
or configure Jasmine.

- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation.
- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.

#### Example

```typescript
describe ('a dog', () => {
  it ('barks', () => {
    # spec here
    describe ('when the dog is happy', () => {
      it ('wags its tail', () => {
        # spec here  
      })
    })
  })
})
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Coast team repositories, but some are specific to `coast-team/mute`.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with a description of when they are used. We  encourage you to read about [search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `coast-team/mute` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.

# MUTE: Multi User Text Editor

Edit documents collaboratively in real-time with hundreds of users on the same document, even with a light server. MUTE implements a CRDT-based consistency algorithm for large scale peer-to-peer collaboration: [LogootSplit](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-structs#ref-1). This algorithm can be seen as an extension for variable-sized elements (e.g. strings) of one of the basic CRDT algorithms for unit elements (e.g. characters).

## :package: Deployment

MUTE runs in the browser, which means that modifications are sent directly to your peers without any intermediary server. However the peer-to-peer technology requires at least a server for the initial discovery and signaling phase. A complete MUTE instance relies on the following services:

## :book: Development

Run `npm install` and start the build/serve watchdog with `npm start`. The application is now available at [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) with the signaling server running at [localhost:8010](http://localhost:8010).)

## :bar_chart: Benchmark

Compared to existing web-based collaborative text editing tools, MUTE does not require a powerful central server since the server is not performing any computation. You can even work offline and reconnect later without losing your changes.

In our experience, performance drops significantly after reaching tens of users on a document on centralized platforms. MUTE doesn't process changes server-side, allowing much larger groups to collaboratively edit a document.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Architecture

MUTE relies on other libraries we develop, which you can reuse in your projects:

- [@coast-team/mute-core](https://gitlab.inria.fr/coast-team/mute/mute-modules/mute-core): core component ensuring typical document-editing operations are done in an orderly fashion
- [@coast-team/mute-structs](https://gitlab.inria.fr/coast-team/mute/mute-modules/mute-structs): an implementation of the [LogootSplit](https://gitlab.inria.fr/coast-team/mute/mute-modules/mute-structs#ref-1) CRDT algorithm
- [@coast-team/mute-crypto](https://gitlab.inria.fr/coast-team/mute/mute-modules/mute-crypto): a group cryptographic key agreement implementation using [Burmester and Desmedt's algorithm](https://gitlab.inria.fr/coast-team/mute/mute-modules/mute-crypto)
- [@coast-team/mute-auth-proxy](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-auth-proxy): assign public/private key pairs to autenticated users, for later use in mute-crypto

MUTE also has a pluggable system of services called *Bots*. They can act like peers in documents to provide
services:

- [@coast-team/mute-bot-storage](https://github.com/coast-team/mute-bot-storage): stores documents for others when you are offline

MUTE exchanges messages by default over WebRTC via:

- [netflux](https://github.com/coast-team/netflux): peer-to-peer browser communication layer
- [sigver](https://github.com/coast-team/sigver): signaling for WebRTC

In the future, any communication layer could be used, like [Pulsar](https://github.com/apache/pulsar) which we support already for increased reliability!

One of the best ways to contribute to MUTE is to help these libraries!

# MUTE: Multi User Text Editor

Edit documents collaboratively in real-time with hundreds of users on the same document, even with a light server. MUTE implements a CRDT-based consistency algorithm for large scale peer-to-peer collaboration: LogootSplit. This algorithm can be seen as an extension for variable-sized elements (e.g. strings) of one of the basic CRDT algorithms for unit elements (e.g. characters).

Compared to existing web-based collaborative text editing tool MUTE does not require a powerful central server since the server is not performing any computation. Communication between browsers editing a document is done in a peer-to-peer fashion thanks to our [Netflux](https://github.com/coast-team/netflux). You can even work offline and reconnect later without losing your changes.

**Demo**: <https://www.coedit.re>

## Deploy your own instance

MUTE is a peer-to-peer collaborative editor in the browser, which means that any user sends their modifications directly to other collaborators instead of transmitting them via a server. However the peer-to-peer technology requires a few servers for full working capacity. Thus the complete MUTE instance is composed of the following servers:

- HTTP(S) server serving MUTE static files.
- WebSocket signaling server which is mandatory in order to establish a connection between two users.
- STAN/TURN help to establish peer-to-peer connection in some scenarios (user is behind a NAT for example).

MUTE comes with a default free STAN server (already deployed on the Internet). TURN server deployment is out of scope of this guide.

Proceeds the following steps:

1.  Deploy Signaling server ([how to](https://github.com/coast-team/sigver)).
2.  Build MUTE static files ([how to](#build)).
3.  Serve static files.

> TIP: If you serve MUTE via HTTPS, the Signaling server should also be secure, i. e. available via `wss` protocol.
>
> TIP: You may find NGINX configuration example in the `conf` folder

**Examples**:

- [Demo deployment on Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/coast-team/mute/wiki/Deploy:-Raspberry-Pi)
- [Production deployment with NGINX on Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/coast-team/mute/wiki/Deploy:-Production)

## Build

Before building the project (creating the static files) you may need to specify a few building parameters in `src/environments/environment.prod.ts`:

```javascript
// src/environments/environment.prod.ts

export const environment = {
  // Production or dev modes
  production: true,

  // If true, shows some information and a few controls for debugging
  // in the bottom right corner of the application window
  devLabel: true,

  // STUN/TURN servers for WebRTC
  // Can be an empty array: []
  // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/RTCIceServer/urls
  iceServers: [
    {
      urls: 'stun.l.google.com:19302',
    },
  ],

  // Signaling server URL
  // See https://github.com/coast-team/sigver
  signalingURL: 'wss://www.coedit.re:10443',

  // Whether MUTE should try to look for a Bot Storage
  // Can be an empty array: []
  // See https://github.com/coast-team/mute-bot-storage
  storages: [
    {
      secure: true, // If true: https & wss protocols are used
      host: 'www.coedit.re', // Server hostname or IP address
      port: 11443, // Server port
    },
  ],
}
```

Once the configurations are set, run `npm run build` command to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Desktop app

To create MUTE desktop distribution, execute:

```shell
npm run build-desktop
```

The executable will be stored in the `dist-desktop/` directory.

### Docker image

A basic `Dockerfile` is provided. It is based on the official [NGINX](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) container (built on top of [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/)) that will serve the packaged angular application.

Run `npm run build` to build the application.
Then, run `docker build -t 'coast-team/mute' .` to build the container image.

You can start a new container using the following command `docker run -it -p 80:80 coast-team/mute`.

## Developer guide

### Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**To test Service Worker**:
Run `npm run start-sw` and navigate to `http://localhost:4300/`.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.
